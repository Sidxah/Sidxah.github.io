I am a first-year Master's student in **Quantum and Distributed Computer Science (QDCS)** at [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), with a strong focus on **Computer Vision**, **Self-Supervised Learning**, and **Multimodal AI**.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **deep representation learning in multimodal models**, particularly CLIP-style architectures that leverage weak textual supervision. I am currently exploring how **fine-grained textual descriptions** (specialized captions) affect vision-language alignment — an underexplored area due to the scarcity of such annotations.

**Keywords**: Self-Supervised Learning, Contrastive Learning (CLIP, SimCLR), Masked Autoencoders (MAE, I-JEPA), Vision-Language Models, Few-Shot Learning

## Current Work

**TER Research Project @ CEA LIST** *(Jan – Apr 2026)*
- Investigating the effect of fine-grained textual descriptions on CLIP-like multimodal representation learning
- Supervised by [Prof. Adrian Popescu](https://adrianpopescu.net/) (LASTI Lab)
- Collaboration with PhD candidate Mehdi Zakaria Adjal

**CLIP Implementation from Scratch** — [GitHub →](https://github.com/Sidxah/CLIP-from-scratch)
- Reproduced the CLIP model (Radford et al., 2021) to deeply understand vision-language alignment
- ResNet-50 vision encoder + Transformer text encoder, trained on Flickr30k
- Achieved **76%+ zero-shot accuracy** on CIFAR-10

**AI Research Engineer @ PyxiScience** *(Aug 2025 – Present)*
- Designing LLM evaluation frameworks comparing GPT-4, Gemini, and DeepSeek
- Working under [Jacques Lévy Véhel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xxx) (former INRIA Research Director, 4,200+ citations)
- Platform serves 10,000+ active students across European universities

## Background

I hold a **Double Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science** from [Sorbonne Paris Nord University](https://www.univ-paris13.fr/) — **ranked Top 7** across all Math & CS programs in L3. This dual training provided solid foundations in both theoretical mathematics and practical computer science.

## Achievements

- 🥉 **Top 3 / 400+ participants** — Hi! Paris Hackathon 2025 (Polytechnique × HEC)
- 📊 **20.75/20** in Mathematics for Data Science (Paris-Saclay)
- 🎓 **Top 7** across all Math & CS programs at Sorbonne Paris Nord (L3)

## Technical Skills

**Deep Learning**: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, TensorFlow

**Concepts**: CNNs, Transformers, Self-Supervised Learning (CLIP, SimCLR, MAE, I-JEPA, DINO), Contrastive Learning, Vision-Language Models

**Programming**: Python, C/C++, Java, OCaml, SQL, Git, Linux, Docker

**ML & Data Science**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Pandas, NumPy

## Looking For

I am seeking a **1–4 month Research Internship** (May – August 2026) in:
- Computer Vision
- Self-Supervised Learning
- Vision-Language Models
- Multimodal AI
