## Overview

Implementation of **Bayesian approaches to image super-resolution**, exploring how prior knowledge about natural image statistics can improve reconstruction quality.

## Motivation

Traditional super-resolution methods often produce over-smoothed results. Bayesian approaches allow us to:
- Incorporate prior knowledge about image statistics
- Quantify uncertainty in reconstructions
- Produce more realistic textures and details

## Approach

The project explores:
- **Prior Modeling**: Learning natural image priors from data
- **Likelihood Models**: Modeling the degradation process
- **Posterior Inference**: Efficient sampling and optimization methods

## Key Concepts

- Gaussian Scale Mixture priors for image gradients
- Variational inference for tractable posterior estimation
- Connection to modern deep learning approaches (VAEs, diffusion models)

## Technologies

`PyTorch` `Probabilistic Programming` `Image Processing` `Variational Inference`

## Status

🔄 **In Progress**
