## Overview

Comprehensive comparison of different algorithmic approaches to solve the classic **0/1 Knapsack problem**, a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization.

## Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Programming
- Bottom-up tabulation approach
- Time complexity: O(n×W)
- Space optimization techniques

### 2. Greedy Approach
- Fractional knapsack adaptation
- Heuristic-based selection
- Approximation bounds analysis

### 3. Backtracking
- Branch and bound optimization
- Pruning strategies
- State space tree exploration

## Analysis

- **Time complexity** comparison across different input sizes
- **Space complexity** trade-offs
- **Solution quality** for greedy approximations
- Visualization of algorithm behavior

## Key Findings

- Dynamic programming provides optimal solutions but requires O(n×W) space
- Greedy approaches offer speed but no optimality guarantee for 0/1 variant
- Backtracking with pruning can outperform DP for sparse instances

## Technologies

`Python` `Algorithm Analysis` `Data Visualization` `Complexity Theory`

## Status

✅ **Completed**
