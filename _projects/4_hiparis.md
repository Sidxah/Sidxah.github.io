## Overview

First ML competition experience at the **Hi!Paris Hackathon** organized by **Polytechnique × HEC**.

## Challenge

Develop a predictive model for complex weather forecasting using multi-variate meteorological data.

## Approach

### AutoML Strategy
- Utilized **AutoGluon** for efficient model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Explored ensemble methods including stacking

### Feature Engineering
- Created temporal features from timestamps
- Engineered interaction features between weather variables
- Applied domain knowledge for feature selection

### Optimization
- Focused on weighted F1-score optimization
- Balanced precision and recall across weather categories

## Results

- **55% accuracy** on complex multi-class forecasting task
- **Top 30%** ranking among 200+ participants
- Valuable experience in rapid iteration under time constraints

## Key Learnings

- AutoML tools for efficient prototyping
- Importance of feature engineering in tabular data
- Competition dynamics and time management

## Technologies
